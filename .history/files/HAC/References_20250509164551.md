This markdown file lists some papers I have read during my research, focusing on the best proportion of human and generative AI in text co-creation. I list their title, source(i.e. where do I find this paper) and hyperlink. I ensure that these papers have either been accepted or submitted to top conferences or journals in their communities. For each paper listed below, I have read its **Abstract**, **Introduction**, and **Conclusion** sections. Papers marked with a single asterisk (*) indicate that I have thoroughly read the entire paper, while those marked with a double asterisk (\*\*) signify that I have carefully studied the paper and successfully reproduced its methods.. Some papers, which I have only read the **Abstract** of or learned about from online presentations, are not included in this list. 

## 1 Human-AI Text Co-Creation

### 1.1 Human-AI Collaboration

Human-AI Collaboration(HAC) is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on designing better human-AI collaborative systems. It is primarily studied by researchers from computer science(CS), information system(IS), and human-computer interaction(HCI) communities. Their research focus on different subtopics: IS community mainly study the societal impact of generative AI(e.g. LLM) and how to tailor co-creation systems tailored for specific social topics(e.g. product ideation), CS community mainly evaluates how different co-creation paradigms affect content and human perspectives, while HCI community primarily explores ways to improve human-computer interaction. Therefore, I categorize these paper from a disciplinary perspective.
