This markdown file lists some papers I have read during my research, focusing on improving LLM-based financial risk prediction by Retrieval Augmented Generation(i.e. RAG). I list their title, source(i.e. where do I find this paper) and hyperlink. These papers have either been accepted or submitted to top conferences or journals in their communities. For each paper listed below, I have read its **Abstract**, **Introduction**, and **Conclusion** sections. Papers marked with a single asterisk (*) indicate that I have thoroughly read the entire paper, while those marked with a double asterisk (\*\*) signify that I have carefully critique the paper and successfully reproduced its methods(if it has). Some papers, which I have only read the **Abstract** of or learned about from online presentations, are not included in this list. **I have also read a [textbook](https://llmbook-zh.github.io/) about large language models (LLMs). I'll continue to deepen my understanding of LLMs and its related applications.**
