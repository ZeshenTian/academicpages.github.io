I have worked in this project for 6 months and are still working on it. I discussed all the details of the project with my supervisor, and we have developed a well-designed technical methods. Currently, I am conducting the experiments. The final manuscript will be submitted for publication, and I will be listed as the first author. We are trying to design better Retrieval Augmented Generation(i.e. RAG) to help large language models(i.e. llms) predict financial risk more accurately. For financial data, we are trying to develop simple yet effective pre-retrieve artifacts to help llms understand numerical data. For non-financial text data, we argue that unlike generation tasks, only use semantic similarity doesn't mean relevant. We are trying to develop three factors to further evaluate if this text is relevant to the company's financial risk. We already explore clear technical paths and are doing some experiments.
