Develop an algorithm that can improve graph collaborative filtering. This serves as a contribution to a work that will submit to top CS journals(CCF Rank A) like KDD. I serve as the second author of that paper. We study how to improve graph contrastive learning algorithms to improve collaborative filtering in the core reason why it works. By further analysis it, we develop a layer-wise contrastive learning methods to improve it. Experiments demonstrate that our methods can improve it.
