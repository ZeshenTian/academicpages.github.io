title: "The Best Proportion of Human and Generative AI During Collaboration: Insights from Synthetic Text Data"

I worked in this project for two months. handling all the hands-on aspects, including topic selection, data acquisition, idea development, experimentation, and writing, with my supervisor focusing on providing high-level guidance.. I found that existing research on Human-AI Collaboration focuses on the impact of whether AI is used and different ways of using AI on various problems, while overlooking the key factor of the human-AI ratio. Therefore, <b>leveraging synthesized text data, we investigated the impact of different human-AI ratios on text quality</b>.  Using five common NLP metrics, we indicate that a human-dominant, AI-assisted collaboration mode results in the highest text quality. Our study is a preliminary investigation into the human-AI ratio in collaboration, and it partially addresses the gap in this field in this regard.
