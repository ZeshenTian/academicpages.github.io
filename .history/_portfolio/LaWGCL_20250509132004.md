I worked in this project for 6 months. I independently came up with the idea and designed the experiment, while the research topic was discussed with my PhD supervisor and my mentor. We study how to improve graph contrastive learning algorithms to improve collaborative filtering from the core reason why it works. By further analysis why InfoNCE-based contrastive learning works well for graph collaborative filtering, we develop a layer-wise contrastive learning methods to improve it. Experiments demonstrate that our methods work well. [sildes]()
