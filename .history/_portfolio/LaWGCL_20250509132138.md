I worked in this project for 6 months. I independently came up with the idea and designed the experiment, while the research topic was discussed with my PhD supervisor and mentor. We study how to improve graph contrastive learning algorithms to improve collaborative filtering from the core reason why it works. By further analysis why InfoNCE-based contrastive learning performs well for graph collaborative filtering, we developed a layer-wise contrastive learning approach to enhance it. Experiments demonstrate that our methods work well compared to other methods. For more details, please refer to the [sildes]().
