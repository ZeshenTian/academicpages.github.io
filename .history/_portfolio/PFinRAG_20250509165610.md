I have been working on this project for six months and am still actively involved. I discussed all the project details with my supervisor, and together we developed a well-designed methodological framework. Currently, I am conducting experiments. The final manuscript will be submitted for publication, with myself listed as the first author.
Our goal is to design an improved Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to help large language models (LLMs) predict financial risks more accurately. <b>For financial data, we are developing simple yet effective pre-retrieval artifacts to assist LLMs in understanding financial ratios. For non-financial text data, we argue that, unlike generation tasks, relying solely on semantic similarity does not necessarily indicate relevance. Therefore, we are exploring additional factors to better evaluate whether the text is relevant to the companyâ€™s financial risk.</b> For more details, please refer to the [references](/files/FinRAG/References.html).
