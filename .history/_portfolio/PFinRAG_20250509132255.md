I have worked in this project for 6 monthsWe are working to design better Retrieval Augmented Generation(i.e. RAG) to help large language models(i.e. llms) predict financial risk more accurately. For financial data, we are trying to develop simple yet effective pre-retrieve artifacts to help llms understand numerical data. For non-financial text data, we argue that unlike generation tasks, only use semantic similarity doesn't mean relevant. We are trying to develop three factors to further evaluate if this text is relevant to the company's financial risk. We already explore clear technical paths and are doing some experiments.
