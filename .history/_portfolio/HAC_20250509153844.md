I worked in this project for 2 months. I handled all the hands-on aspects of the project (topic selection, data acquisition, idea development, experimentation, writing, etc.), with my supervisor focusing on providing high-level direction. I found that existing research on Human-AI Collaboration focuses on the impact of whether AI is used and different ways of using AI on various problems, while overlooking the key factor of the human-AI ratio. Therefore, <b>leveraging synthesized text data, we investigated the impact of different human-AI ratios on text quality</b>.  Using five common NLP metrics, we indicate that a human-dominant, AI-assisted collaboration mode results in the highest text quality. Our study is a preliminary investigation into the human-AI ratio in collaboration, and it partially addresses the gap in this field in this regard.
