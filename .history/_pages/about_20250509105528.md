## About Me

I'm Charles Tian(田泽珅), a third-year undergraduate at School of Management, Hefei University of Technology. I major in information management and information systems.

I previous worked in various research topics. Firstly, I was a research assistant in [Key Laboratory of Knowledge Engineering with Big Data](https://lab.zhonghuapu.com/) in Hefei University of Technology, School of Computer and Information, focusing on graph contrastive learning for collaborative filtering. Then, supervised by [Prof. Jun Pei](http://www.drpeijun.com/), I explored the area of Human-AI Collaboration. Currently, under the guidance of [Prof. Zhao Wang](https://www.hfut.edu.cn/glxyen/info/1074/1534.htm), I'm trying to augment llms(e.g. RAG, tool use) to enhance financial risk prediction.

My research interests lie in the interdisciplinary between AI and business and now I'm particularly interested in the application of AI in finance. The research methods I am interested in include large language models, graph neural networks, self-supervised learning, natural language processing and deep learning. I am also interested in starting my own business to provide AI-based solutions to real-world financial and business problems.
