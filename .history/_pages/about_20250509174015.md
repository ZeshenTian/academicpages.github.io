## About Me

I'm Charles Tian (田泽珅), a third-year undergraduate at the School of Management, [Hefei University of Technology](https://international.hfut.edu.cn/en/). I am majoring in information management and information systems.

I have experience working on various research topics. Initially, I served as a research assistant in [Key Laboratory of Knowledge Engineering with Big Data](https://lab.zhonghuapu.com/) in Hefei University of Technology, School of Computer and Information, focusing on graph contrastive learning for collaborative filtering. Then, supervised by [Prof. Jun Pei](https://www.hfut.edu.cn/glxyen/info/1073/1499.htm), I explored the field of Human-AI Collaboration. Currently, under the guidance of [Prof. Zhao Wang](https://www.hfut.edu.cn/glxyen/info/1074/1534.htm), I am working on developing improved augmentation strategies for large language models (e.g.RAG) to enhance financial risk prediction.

My research interests lie at the intersection of AI and business and <b>now I am particularly interested in leveraging behavioral finance to improve financial forecasting tasks</b>. The research methods I am most interested in include language models, graph neural networks, self-supervised learning, natural language processing and deep learning. Additionally, I am passionate about starting my own business to provide AI-based solutions for real-world financial and business challenges.
