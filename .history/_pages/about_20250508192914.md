## About Me

I'm Charles Tian(田泽珅), a third-year undergraduate at School of Management, Hefei University of Technology.

I previous worked in various research topics. Firstly, I was a research assistant in [Key Laboratory of Knowledge Engineering with Big Data](https://lab.zhonghuapu.com/) in Hefei University of Technology, School of Computer and Information, focusing on graph contrastive learning for collaborative filtering. Then, supervised by [Prof.Jun Pei](http://www.drpeijun.com/), I explored the area of Human-AI Collaboration, especially. Currently, under the guidance of [Prof. Zhao Wang](https://www.hfut.edu.cn/glxyen/info/1074/1534.htm), I'm exploring how to augment llms(e.g. RAG, tool use) to enhance financial risk prediction. Please check the [research projects]() pages and my [CV](https://zeshentian.github.io/files/CV.pdf) for more details.

My research interests lie in the interdisciplinary between AI and business, especially AI for finance. Methodologies in AI for finance include deep learning, natural language processing, graph neural networks, and contrastive learning. I'm also interested in making my own business in business and AI for fintech.
