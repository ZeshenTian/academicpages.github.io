In this presentation, I discuss a paper published in Information Systems Research within the [Information Systems Paper Sharing Group](https://siyuan-bruce.github.io/reading_group/home.html), a platform for junior IS researchers to exchange research ideas. I provided a clear overview of the paperâ€™s details, highlighted the emerging trend of integrating design science and economics, explored potential improvements to the proposed model, and recommended related articles for further reading. For more information, please refer to the [slides](https://zeshentian.github.io/files/talk.pptx) of the presentation.
